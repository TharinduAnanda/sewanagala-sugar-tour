SEWANAGALA SUGAR TOUR - TUNNEL SETUP
========================================

SERVICES RUNNING:
-----------------
1. Next.js Server: Running in PowerShell Window 1
   - Local URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Port: 3000

2. LocalTunnel: Running in PowerShell Window 2
   - Check the PowerShell window for your public URL
   - It will show: "your url is: https://XXXXX.loca.lt"

HOW TO ACCESS:
--------------
1. Look at the LocalTunnel PowerShell window
2. Find the URL that looks like: https://something-words.loca.lt
3. Visit that URL in your browser
4. When asked for "Tunnel Password", use: 212.104.231.78

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Keep BOTH PowerShell windows open (closing them stops the services)
- The tunnel URL changes each time you restart
- Password is your public IP: 212.104.231.78
- Visitors only need to enter password once per 7 days

TO STOP SERVICES:
-----------------
Close both PowerShell windows or press Ctrl+C in each window

TO RESTART:
-----------
1. Open PowerShell in project folder
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Open another PowerShell in project folder  
4. Run: npx localtunnel --port 3000
5. Note the new URL from step 4

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you get 503 errors:
- Make sure Next.js window shows "Ready"
- Wait 10 seconds after starting both services
- Refresh the browser page

If password doesn't work:
- Try exactly: 212.104.231.78 (no spaces)
- Check if your IP changed: curl.exe https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword
